Your solutions to computational questions should include any specified Python code and results as well as written commentary on your conclusions.  Remember that you are encouraged to discuss the problems with your classmates, but **you must write all code and solutions on your own**.\n",

    "- Any relevant data sets should be available under the **Data** module on Canvas.\n",
    "- If you're not familiar with typesetting math directly into Markdown then by all means, do your work on paper first and then typeset it later.  Remember that there is a [reference guide](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference) linked on Canvas on writing math in Markdown. **All** of your written commentary, justifications and mathematical work should be in Markdown.\n",
    "- Because you can technically evaluate notebook cells is a non-linear order, it's a good idea to do Kernel $\\rightarrow$ Restart & Run All as a check before submitting your solutions.  That way if we need to run your code you will know that it will work as expected. \n",
    "- It is **bad form** to make your reader interpret numerical output from your code.  If a question asks you to compute some value from the data you should show your code output **AND** write a summary of the results in Markdown directly below your code. \n",

    "From the above result, we can see that nodes 2 and 7 end up with the most \"flow\" and nodes 4, 5 and 6 with the least. This makes sense from the graph because there's a \"loop\" from nodes $2 \\rightarrow 1 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 5 \\rightarrow 6 \\rightarrow 3$, where the loop ends at either 7 or 3. Because all of those node, beside 3, have an outward edge to 7, it makes sense that 7 has a large amount of the flow. Then nodes 7 and 3 only lead to node 2, meaning all flow eventually leads through there causing it to also has a large stationary value. Nodes 4, 5 and 6 all have progressively smaller values because they are further down the loop, where each step has the chance of moving to Node 7, so getting further is less likely."
