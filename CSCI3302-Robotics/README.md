CSCI3302: Intro to Robotics

Included topics on how to translate code and math into degrees of motion, using sensory data, detecting obstacles. 

All of the labs involved issuing commands to a Sparki robot to complete certain commands like recognizing sensory data, moving a set amount and picking up objects.

Final project was the Dynamic Quadcopter Movement, which is in a different github repository. https://github.com/adamtenhoeve/DynamicQCopterMovement
