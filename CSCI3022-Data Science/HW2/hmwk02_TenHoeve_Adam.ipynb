    "For my simulation, I created an adjacency list to represent the graph. Each element in the list represents a node in the graph and contains a list of paths to the connected nodes. To simulate a random path, it chooses a path within the inital node list which corresponds to get to another node in the adjacency list. This process can be repeated $n$ times to simulate $n$-steps for both Oscar and Stella. This is a reasonable approxmation of the probabilities from the parts above because it accuretly represents a uniform choice at each node and the simulations are repeated $50,000$ times, which is enough to consistenly show that the probability is within $\\pm 0.01$ of the calculated probability."

    "**Part C**: In the in-class notebook associated with Lecture 4 (nb04) we plotted a running estimate of the probability of an event as a function of the number of trials in our simulation.  Write code to run at least 10 independent simulations of at least 50,000 trials each to estimate $P(C)$ and plot their running estimate curves on the same set of axes. **Hint**: This is a lot of computation, so try to leverage Numpy as much as possible so that your code doesn't run forever.

    "You’re on the north shore of a river, and want to cross to the south, via a series of 13 bridges and six islands, which you can see in the diagram below. But, as you approach the water, night falls, a bad storm rolls in, and you’re forced to wait until morning to try to cross. Overnight, the storm could render some of the bridges unusable — it has a 50 percent chance of knocking out each of the bridges. (The chance is independent for each bridge.)\n",
